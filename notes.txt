±  |master ✗| → rails g rails_admin:install
           -  Hello, RailsAdmin installer will help you sets things up!
           -  I need to work with Devise, let's look at a few things first:
           -  Checking for a current installation of devise...
           -  Found it!
           -  Looks like you don't have devise installed! We'll install it for you:
    generate  devise:install
      create  config/initializers/devise.rb
      create  config/locales/devise.en.yml
===============================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root :to => "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

       config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

     On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
     or load models when precompiling your assets.

  5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g devise:views

===============================================================================
           ?  Where do you want to mount rails_admin? Press <enter> for [admin] >
        gsub  config/routes.rb
       route  mount RailsAdmin::Engine => '/admin', :as => 'rails_admin'
           ?  What would you like the user model to be called? Press <enter> for [user] >
           -  Now setting up devise with user model name 'user':
    generate  devise
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20131103182130_devise_create_users.rb
      create    app/models/user.rb
      invoke    rspec
      create      spec/models/user_spec.rb
      insert    app/models/user.rb
       route  devise_for :users
           -  Now you'll need an initializer...
           -  You already have a config file. You're updating, heh? I'm generating a new 'rails_admin.rb.example' that you can review.
      create  config/initializers/rails_admin.rb.example
           -  current_user_method found and updated with 'current_user'
        gsub  config/initializers/rails_admin.rb
           -  Adding a migration...
           -  Another migration is already named create_rails_admin_histories_table: /Users/billcassidy/workspace/UB5/db/migrate/20131022174546_create_rails_admin_histories_table.rb
           -  Job's done: migrate, start your server and visit '/admin'!
